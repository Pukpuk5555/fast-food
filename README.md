### About Project
This project began in the Visual Scripting course, where I created the first prototype using tools like GameMaker. My friend and I used visual scripting to implement the full core systems ‚Äî including the weight mechanic and hazard interactions ‚Äî which allowed me to clearly visualize and understand how gameplay elements connect and respond to each other.
Later, in the Game Analytics course, I recreated the entire project in Unity using C#, carrying over all original systems and improving them with smoother controls, custom animations, and refined feedback. This transition helped me deepen my understanding of programming and real-time gameplay logic.

<br>**Game Concept**
<br>A 2D platformer where the player must escape from a surreal nightmare filled with deadly, food-themed traps. I proposed and designed the core concept: food consumption directly affects the character‚Äôs body and abilities, turning survival into a strategic challenge.
- üçî Eating junk food makes the character heavier and slower
- ü•ó Eating healthy food makes the character lighter and more agile
<br>This mechanic adds a fun twist to traditional platforming and subtly promotes health awareness through gameplay. The game combines humor, fast-paced action, and educational value in a unique dreamlike setting.

<br>**Note**
<br>This game is currently in a **playable and complete state**, meaning the full gameplay loop can be experienced from start to finish.  
However, there are still many areas for future enhancement, including adding sound effects, background music, and expanding levels to enrich the player experience.
